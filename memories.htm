<font size="3">by: A Broken Hearted</font></font></h2>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FFFFFF">How can I, 
Susan, ever forget,<br>
For loving the Guy four years I have met.<br>
His love will I ever get?<br>
Him to painfully go, how could I let?</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#FFFFFF" face="Book Antiqua">I could still 
remember the first day,<br>
I could never forget the words he did say.<br>
My love for him grew deeper everyday,<br>
Beside him, I always wanted to stay.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FFFFFF">A year went on, he 
was still my classmate,<br>
Rejoiced I was for such fate.<br>
To tell him my feelings, I could not make,<br>
I guess I'll have to wait for the chances to take.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FFFFFF">The next year came, 
another section he was,<br>
The distance became farther between the both of us.<br>
No longer could I see him in class,<br>
I don't know how long will this last.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FFFFFF">Then was High 
School's last year,<br>
Came out one of the things I did fear,<br>
Only could I shed a tear,<br>
But could not come to him near.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FFFFFF">This time, he's 
already taken,<br>
The news have made me weaken.<br>
In choosing him, have I mistaken?<br>
For my love, he had forsaken.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FFFFFF">The JS Prom that 
year was a failure,<br>
He didn't danced with me for sure.<br>
Like the poem, &quot;<a target="_blank" href="Prom.htm" style="text-decoration: none"><font color="#FFFFFF">The 
Prom Nightmare</font></a>&quot;, but not that pure,<br>
For I am still searching for a cure.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FFFFFF">During that night, 
he didn't gave me a chance,<br>
He instead asked other girls for a dance,<br>
I could only take a simple glance,<br>
To the person who didn't gave me just once.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Book Antiqua" color="#FFFFFF">What would vanish is 
the Pain,<br>
But the scars would still remain.<br>
Love of my life, will I ever gain?<br>
For I am still waiting in vain.</font></p>
